# bash-dwsclass
this is a bash script practice for dwsclass. run your bash command if it's valid command.

for try.sh you should pass at least 5 argument. option -i is for Time and -n is for Number of reapeat run command.
if your command is valid result show if not the command run for times that you pass in -n option and reapeat in x secondes that you pass in -i option.

fro try2.sh options -i and -n is optional that means you can don't pass them. the app read variables time and number of reapeat from $ENV if not set in $ENV app use defualt value for them.
